# posh-sonicwall
A powershell module for executing commands/command scripts on a sonicwall.

For the moment the items in this repo are crude, but I wanted to upload them as I have time to learn how some of this works. A significant amount of interfacing with the somicwall through SSH streams I learned from this article I found: https://tylercrew.com/?p=152.
